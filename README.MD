# Custom ROM(s) Tracker 

## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to make it easy for developers to know when each ROM updates their manifest and/or FW/Base repo. This project hopes to help users by letting them know when the source of a ROM is updated.

## Links

* [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/ROM_tracker)

## Technicalities

* Should update itself every 30 minutes
* Runs fully on GitHub actions
For more, my code is open-source, you make take a read at it
  
## Currently tracked ROMs

You can check [this list](https://github.com/geek0609/rom-tracker/blob/new-implementation/Tracked_ROMs.MD) which is auto updated everytime I include another ROM to my list. If you feel that I have missed out anything, make sure to edit [this file (roms.txt)](https://github.com/geek0609/rom-tracker/blob/new-implementation/roms.txt) and/or [this file(roms1.txt)](https://github.com/geek0609/rom-tracker/blob/new-implementation/roms1.txt) (Note that one .txt file can only contain 60 repos for it to work properly) and [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) so I can add them easier. 


If you find any issue, make sure to create [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue), so I can work on it better. If you think it is not well commented or if you can suggest a more efficient code, PLEASE OPEN A PULL REQUEST, I would love to look at it.
